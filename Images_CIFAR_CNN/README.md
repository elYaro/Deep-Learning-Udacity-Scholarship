# Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
I took part in intensive 2 months Deep Learning Udacity Scholarship sponsored by Facebook. 
This is my secont neural network recognises images from CIFAR dataset.
Neural network as CNN model (Convolutional neural network as few first lawyers + multi layer perceptron at the end).
Code was written in Jubiter Notebook.
